# This uipath file fetches the marks of three semesters from the college website (in my case it is VTOP) and and stores them in a excel workbook with each sheet name as their semester name.
<h3>After it fetches the data it updates the grades based on absolute grading and calculates the gpa .</h3>
<h3>The calculated gpa of all the semester along with the overall cgpa is stored in another sheet </h3>
